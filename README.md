# dotfiles
I am in the constant pursuit of the never ending journey of improving myself in every way possible. In order to maximize my productivity I use fish, neovim, tmux and hyparland for the most productivity. These dotfiles give the tools and their respective configurations I am constantly updating to maximize my productivity. Feel free to copy to your dotfiles config, fork or even do a pr.
# shells
## fish
I use fish as my daily driver shell. Fish is a great shell for someone like me that has read enough propaganda to get convinced not to learn how to use those POSIX compliant human unfriendly scripted shells-yes you bash and zsh. But I am hoping to change my attitude and learn those
shells one day.
To install and manage fish's plugins I use fisher btw. You can install fisher from this link
https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher
## zsh
This zsh configuration is a fork of Dreams of Autonomy' zsh config with some changes to his aliases. I don't use zsh so I don't think I will be updating this config. My plan is incase I MUST use the zsh shell I can quickly clone this file and copy it to my .zshrc file. 
## bash
[[To-do]]
# desktop enviroment
I use sddm simply because it can seamlessly run Hyprland.
## hyprland
I am too lazy to learn hyprland so I have copied this immaculate hyprland config which I recommend for anyone who is lazy like me and wants anice out of the box hyprland rice for arch btw. He also has a nice hyprland for debian/fedora and the others I am too lazy to find and link.
# session managers
## tmux
Most of my tmux config is from typecraft and dreamsofautonomy's tmux config but I think it's a great config just it needs some plugin for copying and pasting text from a terminal which is awful rn.
## zellij
I have this as a backup for tmux
# text editors 
## Neovim
[[To-do]] --SERIOUSLY Keane
1. Add and setup harpoon2( Yes that's a Prime and Brazil mentioned )
2. Setup up that fuzzy finder whatever it's called
3. Watch more Prime to find out more about his config
4. Hate emacs
