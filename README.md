# dotfiles
I realised I might actually going to be punching pieces of code into a screen for the next 20 or more years. Therefore I have decided to dedicate some time to learn and config my workflow. I use archlinux btw, fish, neovim and tmux as my daily driver but this config has tools and configurations that might make it easier for me to work in outside my normal config.
# shells
## fish
Fish is a great shell for someone like me that has read enough propaganda to get convinced not to learn how to use those POSIX compliant human unfriendly scripted shells-yes you bash and zsh. But I am hoping to change my attitude and learn those
shells one day.
To install and manage fish's plugins I use fisher btw. You can install fisher from this link

I use these plugins on my fish

## zsh
This zsh configuration is a fork of Dreams of Autonomy' zsh config with some changes to his aliases. I don't use zsh so I don't think I will be updating this config. My plan is incase I MUST use zsh, I can quickly clone this file and copy it to my .zshrc file. 
## bash
[[To-do]]
## powershell
I rarely use Windows but whenever I want to use windows I find this config to be great for me.
# desktop enviroment
I use sddm simply because it can seamlessly run Hyprland.
## hyprland
i am too lazy to learn hyprland so i have copied this immaculate hyprland config which i recommend for anyone who is lazy like me and wants a nice out of the box hyprland rice for arch btw. he also has a nice hyprland for debian and fedora

# session managers
## tmux
Most of my tmux config is from typecraft and dreamsofautonomy's tmux config but I think it's a great config just it needs some plugin for copying and pasting text from a terminal which is awful rn.
# text editors 
## Neovim
My neovim config is tailored for Java, C and x86 assembly as I am currently learning this in university.
1. Setup up autosession, trouble, comments
2. Add and setup harpoon2
3. Watch more Prime to find out more about his config
4. Hate on emacs
5. Setup up debuggers for java, c
